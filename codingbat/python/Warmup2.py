def string_times(str, n):
    '''
    Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string.
    '''
    pass

def front_times(str, n):
    '''
    Given a string and a non-negative int n, we'll say that the front of the
    string is the first 3 chars, or whatever is there if the string is less
    than length 3. Return n copies of the front;
    '''
    pass

def string_bits(str):
    '''
    Given a string, return a new string made of every other char starting with
    the first, so "Hello" yields "Hlo".
    '''
    pass

def string_splosion(str):
    '''
    Given a non-empty string like "Code" return a string like "CCoCodCode".
    '''
    pass

def last2(str):
    '''
    Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring
    length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string,
    so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).
    '''
    pass

def array_count9(nums):
    '''
    Given an array of ints, return the number of 9's in the array.
    '''
    pass

def array_front9(nums):
    '''
    Given an array of ints, return True if one of the first 4 elements in the
    array is a 9. The array length may be less than 4.
    '''
    pass

def array123(nums):
    '''
    Given an array of ints, return True if .. 1, 2, 3, .. appears in the
    array somewhere.
    '''
    pass

def string_match(a, b):
    '''
    Given 2 strings, a and b, return the number of the positions where they
    contain the same length 2 substring. So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3,
    since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in
    both strings.
    '''
    pass
