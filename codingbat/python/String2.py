def count_code(str):

    Return the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in the

def end_other(a, b):
    '''
    Given two strings, return True if either of the strings appears at the
    very end of the other string, ignoring upper/lower case differences (in
    other words, the computation should not be "case sensitive").
    Note: s.lower() returns the lowercase version of a string.
    '''
    pass

def xyz_there(str):
    '''
    Return True if the given string contains an appearance of "xyz" where the
    xyz is not directly preceeded by a period (.). So "xxyz" counts but "x.xyz"
    does not.
    '''
    pass
